#+TITLE: Akka + ScalaPB protobuf + scalajs playground

* Description

A playground to learn how protobuf can be integrated in a akka (remoting) + scalajs project.

** ScalaPB

[[http://trueaccord.github.io/ScalaPB/][ScalaPB]] is used to generate scala classes from protobuf file.

The generation is done twice, once for scalajs and once for the jvm part.

** Backend server

The server can be invoked with the `backend` argument to start a webserver and a akka remotely reachable system.

** Akka remoting test

Invoking the server with the `remote-client` argument will start an akka system which will connect to the backend and communicate with it using protobuf messages.

** Scalajs test

Opening a browser to http://127.0.0.1:8888 will open the javascript test Client. The Client serialize a few messages and post them to the webserver which deserialize them.

* Usage

Note: you may need the protoc command line tool to be installed (have to check if it's a scalapb requirement or not).

Compile stuff in one terminal:

```
sbt
compile
fastOptJS
```

Start backend in one terminal:

```
sbt "server/run backend"
```

Start akka remote test in another terminal:

```
sbt "server/run remote-client"
```

For javascript, open http://127.0.0.1:8888 and open the developer console.

* Notes

- The generated case classes offer defaults to values and the mix of optional + default in the protobuf file may not generate what you would expect.
